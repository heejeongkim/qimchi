Demonstration of QMLChilinet
================================
This demo is to show how to add client objects and state objects to QML.
There are three kinds of states in the demo, and you can change each state by clicking a button the interface (F-ctrl / A-ctrl/ S-ctrl).

Following is a short description of each state:
Classroom state: This state is shared among clients. The state can be either ‘Freeze’ or ‘Normal’.
Activity state: The change to this state will be logged in a file named ‘activity’. You can find this log file in a directory where an executable file is placed.
Stage state: This is an example of a local state. The change to this state will be neither shared, nor logged.

How to run the demo
=====================
To run a qmlchilinet-demo, you need to install not only Chilitags and OpenCV, but also ZMQ 4.0.4 and CZMQ.
You also need to write IP address of your server to main.qml file. (In main.qml file, find ChiliClient object and set ‘svrIp’ property.)
